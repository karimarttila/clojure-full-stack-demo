# Javascript-Node (backend) / Typescript-React (frontend) demonstration app

## Introduction

I created a Javascript-Node (backend) / Typescript-React (frontend) demonstration for my personal learning purposes: [js-node-ts-react](https://github.com/karimarttila/js-node-ts-react). I promised to keep a Clojure lecture in my new corporation, and for this lecture, I thought that it might be interesting for the audience to provide them two exact same full-stack applications: one written using the Javascript ecosystem, and one using Clojure. This way my colleagues can, later on, compare these two solutions and make it easier to start learning Clojure when you can compare various backend and frontend solutions to a more familiar Javascript/Typescript example. I have actually created several versions of this webstore example using several languages.
